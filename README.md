Overview
========

Since every chef installation needs a chef repository I created this repo using opscode/chef-repo as a base. This repo currently contians 3 cookbooks, which have been created for learning how to integrate chef with vagrant.

The cookbooks in this repository can be used for installing, configuring, and launching a torquebox instance on a vagrant box running Ubuntu 12.04.

Read the README file in each of the subdirectories for more information about what goes in those directories.
